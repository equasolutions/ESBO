# ESBO Reference Cases
This is a collection of reference building simulation cases created and simulated in ESBO 

# ESBO
ESBO is a simulation tool for building design optimization based on EQUAâ€™s building performance software IDA Indoor Climate and Energy (IDA ICE). More information can be found at https://www.equa.se/en/esbo

# Installation
ESBO Light can be downloaded for free a number of sources https://www.equa.se/en/esbo/trial-version
